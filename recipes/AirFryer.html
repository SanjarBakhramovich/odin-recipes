      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Cook macaroni pasta
        from the dinner package in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until
        tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain; do not rinse. Return pasta to the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir cheese sauce from the dinner package, milk, and margarine into
        pasta. Mix in Cheddar cheese until well combined and cheese is melted.
        Transfer macaroni and cheese to a bowl and refrigerate until firm, 2
        hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoop chilled macaroni and cheese into 1 1/2-inch balls and place on a
        parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Freeze for 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) according to
        manufacturer's instructions. Spray the basket with nonstick cooking
        spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place beaten eggs in a bowl. Mix together panko, bread crumbs, salt, and
        garlic powder in a shallow bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip each frozen macaroni and cheese ball in beaten eggs, then press in
        bread crumb mixture to coat. Place coated balls into the prepared air
        fryer basket in a single layer with space between; cook in batches if
        necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook in the preheated air fryer for 6 to 8 minutes. Turn over and fry
        until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes more.
